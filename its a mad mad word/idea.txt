have a label 

four radio buttons making a group 

A set of words and their meanings 

Random : 

1. Generate a word randomly and have its meaning 

Random r = new Random 

int t = r.nextInt(words.length); 

word = words[t]

meaning = meaning[t]

String ans = new String[4]; 
int index = new int[4]; 

ans[0] = meaning ; 
index[0] = t ; 

generate three other random words 

for(int i=1;i<4;i++)
{

int x = r.nextInt(words.length)
boolean checker = check(x)
if(checker = true)
ans[i] = words[x]; 
index[i] = x ; 

}

display (word is words[t])

options : 

void randseriesgen()
{
int order = new int[4]; 



}

now i have 4 different answers

how do i put them in different order everytime
